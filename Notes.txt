Want remove or edit a column, remember to do the following:

1. Do a migration : Add-Migration <name of the migration>  very similar to a commit message 
2. Update the database: Update-Database



What if you would like to share this database with someone ?

The Update-Database script would simply run the initial first migration in the list Migrations folder to the most recent file and
its going to roll out all of those changes using the Up and Down method to know what changes it needs to make to create the most recent 
version of the database.


Model - an abstraction of the database table, but in other words a template table\

View Model - an additional abstraction from the actual data model 

Automapper - a library that allows us to do the conversion of the View Model to the actual Model in the data layer easily.

By using a View Model, as the developer you can ramp-up or tone down the level of data the user has access to in a particular view.
It also allows us to do pre-checks before its passed to the repository.
